# Question: Empty vs. Never vs. Of

## EMPTY
> It’s important here to note that while the observer is completed, it emits nothing on it’s way to doing so
```
EMPTY.subscribe(x => {
  console.log('Empty Emit'); //This never fires. 
}, 
null, 
() => {
  console.log('Empty Complete'); //This does. 
});
```
## Of
> I have used of({}), if you instead use Of() with no value, then you will instead complete the observable but not emit a value (Similar to EMPTY).
```
of({}).subscribe(x => {
  console.log('Of Emit'); //This fires. 
}, 
null, 
() => {
  console.log('Of Complete'); //This fires. 
});
```
